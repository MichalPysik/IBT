- Since you cannot compare how complex architectures of different NN types are, maybe try to aim for similar number of trainable parameters

- Maybe delete custom models from application, make 12 predefined ones and focus more on plotting graphs, etc.

- Allow user to save weights of model quadruples, permanent directory split into 3 subdirectories, each with 4 files called model{1,2,3,4}.h5

- Allow to view summaries and plot architectures of models

- button to compile ALL (always ALL) networks, with selected optimizer, loss, metrics

- tickbox of which out of 4 models to plot/summarize, train, test etc.

- plot_model of all 12 models inside Appendix (3 pages * 2x2 model plot matrix)
