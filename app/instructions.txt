-----------------------------------------------------------------
This application provides an interactive interface for comparing
different architectures of artificial neural networks.
-----------------------------------------------------------------
- The app had been built for Python 3.10, and has to be ran from
  the '/app/' folder: 'python3 src/main.py'

- The python3 package requirements can be install via pip3 from
  the '/app/' folder: 'pip3 install -r requirements.txt'

- The 'python3-tk' package has to be installed, e.g. on Ubuntu:
  'sudo apt-get install python3-tk'

- By default, the saved weights of the models are saved to/loaded
  from '/app/saved_weights/{Tabular|Image|Sequential}'

- By default, any plots generated by the app are saved to
  '/app/plots/{Tabular|Image|Sequential}'

- The MiniBooNE particle identification dataset is stored inside
  '/app/datasets/', and it is recommended to store additional
  datasets there as well
-----------------------------------------------------------------
** Common workflow **

1. Select the active experiment. This sets the current context,
   which includes the active dataset and the 4 corresponding
   neural network architectures.

2. Select the active models to be interacted with.

3. Select which metrics should be measured during training and/or
   testing. Loss is always measured by default.

4. Select which plots should be plotted and saved as an image.

5. Select the number of epochs and the batch size, and train
   the selected models.

6. Select whether a confusion matrix should be plotted for each
   model, select the batch size, (optionally change the selected
   metrics) and test the models.
-----------------------------------------------------------------
** Utilities **

+ 'Models -> Save selected' saves the current weights of the
  selected models

+ 'Models -> Load selected' loads the stored weights of the
  selected models

+ 'Screen -> Save as...' can be used to store the current state
  of the main (text) screen to a text file

+ 'Screen -> Clear' clears all text from the main (text) screen

+ 'Help' prints the usage instructions to the main (text) screen
-----------------------------------------------------------------
Note: The models are normally created when the active experiment
is set, in which case the summaries of the models are shown. If
the set of selected models changes after that and an another
model needs to be created, it gets created silently in the
background (no summary, to keep the logs clean). If some models
are unselected after an experiment is selected, they are simply
not used for any interaction until they get selected again.
